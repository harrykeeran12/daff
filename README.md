# `daff` - daily affirmations in the CLI.

This is a small Python program that takes a random line from a set of affirmations and prints it out in the CLI. 

To print out one affirmation use 

```python3 main.py``` 

and use

``` python3 main.py -n=<NUMBER>``` 

to print out a number of affirmations.

Alternatively, the `uv` package manager can be used to run this package using
`uv run main.py`.
